# ESR1 Structural Diversity and Redundancy Assessment

## Objective
Analyze the dataset of **474 estrogen receptor α (ESR1) crystal structures** to:
- Determine structural diversity  
- Identify truly unique conformations  
- Assess whether additional structures provide new biological insights  

Validation will be performed against a comparison set of **37 ESR2 structures**.  

---

## Target Data
- **474 ESR1 crystal structures** from the PDB  
- Structures bound to diverse ligands (agonists, antagonists, SERMs)  
- Multiple crystal forms and experimental conditions  
- **37 ESR2 structures** for cross-receptor comparison  

---

## Approach
1. Cluster ESR1 structures by conformational similarity and ligand types  
2. Identify structural outliers and unique conformational states  
3. Calculate information content and redundancy metrics  
4. Create a minimal representative structural set
